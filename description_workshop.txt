[b]== The Amulet of Many Minions! ==[/b]

The Amulet of Many Minions is a mid-sized content mod that adds variety to the vanilla summoner progression while trying to stay at least somewhat
true to vanilla balance. It adds a new, directly controllable minion type called the [b]Squire[/b],
over 30 new minions, and a minion form for every vanilla pet!
