		 * How this is used:
		 * - Whenever something wants client A's mouse position, access A's players ModPlayer, and calls {GetMousePosition()}
		 *     - It can be null! (if client B hasn't received A's mouse position yet)
		 * 
		 * How this works:
		 * - Client A makes it clear that he wants his mouse position to sync, initiates sending process (by using {SetMousePosition()})
		 *     - Sending process is send MouseWorld every {updateRate} ticks while client wants it
		 * - Server receives, resends to clients (one of them B)
		 *     - B receives {NextMousePosition}, and:
		 *         - if it's the first position received: sets calls {SetNextMousePosition()}
		 *         - else: use UpdateRule() to move {MousePosition} towards the received value
		 *     - If B holds a MousePosition and timeout is reached (no more incoming packets hopefully):
		 *         - nulls {MousePosition} and sets related fields to default
